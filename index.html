	<h2>Interdisciplinary Studies: Digital Media Design and Production</h2>

		<h3>Bio</h3>

			<p>I have quite the eclectic educational background.  In 2008 I started out my collegiate career at California Polytechnic State University: San Luis Obispo studying Aerospace Engineering.  Although engineering was intriguing, my artistic side suffered greatly, so I went on to earn my Associate of Arts from Seattle Central Community College while I focused on finding my new educational path.  Finally I enrolled at Eastern Washington University and completed the junior level of the Film program.  Now I am in my senior year at EWU studying Film, Design, and Art in hopes of going into the field of digital media design and production upon graduation in the spring of 2015.</p>
